            <div>
                <p>
                    Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver
                    software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their
                    own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through
                    well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating
                    system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.
